                    With a strong foundation in Computer Science, Psychology, and Sociology, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of technology and human interaction. Recently graduating with my CS degree, I’m passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and innovative solutions in UX, Game Development, Web, and Software development.
                    My diverse academic background fuels my creativity and technical expertise, allowing me to approach every project as an opportunity to explore new ideas and push boundaries. I’m driven by the challenge of making technology more accessible, engaging, fun, and human-centered.
